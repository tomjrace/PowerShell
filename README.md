# PowerShell
Powershell scripts I wrote and would like to share.
##screenshotter.ps1 
requires imagemagick, take a screenshot of dual monitors and combine them at a set interval. I use it for creating documentation while completing a task, so I dont need to stop and add screenshots of each step individually, I just wait a moment in between each step and later crop the images I want for documentation.
